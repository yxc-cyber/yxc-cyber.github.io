      title: My Research
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I am currently a Master's student in Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), 
        supervised by [Professor Gokhan Tur](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/department-faculty/gokhan). 
        Previously, I was an undergraduate student at New York University Shanghai, majoring in Computer Science and 
        minoring in Mathematics, supervised by 
        [Professor Yik-Cheung (Wilson) Tam](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/yik-cheung-wilson-tam).

        At New York University Shanghai, I conducted research on neural symbolic methods for boosting large language 
        models' reasoning ability and investigated the advantage of using Prolog langauge (a logic programming langauge) 
        as the generation output in terms of data augmentation for finetunining. After that, I explored how large language 
        models could be used to solve dialogua state tracking, which is a key component in task-oriented dialogues, and 
        witnessed a major improvement compared with previous methods.

        Now I have joined the ConvAI Lab at UIUC to explore the how large language models could reshape the form of 
        conversational AI. My research interest primarily lies in AI Agents and machine reasoning. If you are interested 
        in my research demonstrated below or would like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out to me ðŸ˜ƒ!
