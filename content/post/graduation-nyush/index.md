I am graduating from NYU Shanghai. I really appreciate 
[Professor Yik-Cheung (Wilson) Tam](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/yik-cheung-wilson-tam)'s 
supervision in my research in natural language processing. Also, I am grateful to have 
such a wonderful teammate as [Bingsen (Bale) Chen](https://balechen.github.io/). Our work on 
language model arithmetic reasoning has been accepcted by NAACL 2024. This could not 
be accomplished without their devotion and collaboration to this project.
