I will be attending NAACL 2024 in Mexico City. Prolog is a logic language designed for logical inference. But it looks like it has 
faded out of public view. At NAACL 2024, I will present my work on large language model arithmetic reasoning via Prolog generation 
and data argumentation via Prolog code permutation. This method is named as **ProPer** (Prolog generation and permutation). Thanks 
teammate [Bingsen (Bale) Chen](https://balechen.github.io/) for coming up with this nice abbreviation! The experiments have shown that 
Prolog could be a new tool for language models to use to tackle reasoning problems that have been long troubling those equiped with 
the chain-of-thought method.

Cannot wait to see peers and colleagues in person!
