abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have been increasingly used to interact
  with external environments (e.g., games, APIs, etc.) and solve tasks. However, current
  frameworks do not enable these agents to work with users and interact with them
  to align on the details of their tasks and reach user-defined goals; instead, in
  ambiguous situations, these agents may make decisions based on assumptions. This
  work introduces ReSpAct (Reason, Speak, and Act), a novel framework that synergistically
  combines the essential skills for building task-oriented ``conversational'' agents.
  ReSpAct addresses this need for agents, expanding on the ReAct approach. ReSpAct
  framework enables agents to interpret user instructions, reason about complex tasks,
  execute appropriate actions and engage in dynamic dialogue to seek guidance, clarify
  ambiguities, understand user preferences, resolve problems, and use the intermediate
  feedback and responses of users to update their plans. We evaluated ReSpAct with
  GPT-4 in environments supporting user interaction, such as task-oriented dialogue
  (MultiWOZ) and interactive decision-making (Alfworld, WebShop), ReSpAct is flexible
  enough to incorporate dynamic user feedback and addresses prevalent issues like
  error propagation and agents getting stuck in reasoning loops. This results in more
  interpretable, human-like task-solving trajectories than baselines relying solely
  on reasoning traces. In two interactive decision-making benchmarks, AlfWorld and
  WebShop, ReSpAct outperforms strong reasoning-only method ReAct by an absolute success
  rate of 6% and 4%, respectively. In the task-oriented dialogue benchmark MultiWOZ,
  ReSpAct improved Inform and Success scores by 5.5% and 3%, respectively.
