abstract: Language model agents excel in long-session planning and reasoning, but
  existing benchmarks primarily focus on goal-oriented tasks with explicit objectives,
  neglecting creative adaptation in unfamiliar environments. To address this, we introduce
  EscapeBench---a benchmark suite of room escape game environments designed to challenge
  agents with creative reasoning, unconventional tool use, and iterative problem-solving
  to uncover implicit goals. Our results show that current LM models, despite employing
  working memory and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, achieve only 15% average progress
  without hints, highlighting their limitations in creativity. To bridge this gap,
  we propose EscapeAgent, a framework designed to enhance creative reasoning through
  Foresight (innovative tool use) and Reflection (identifying unsolved tasks). Experiments
  show that EscapeAgent can execute action chains over 1,000 steps while maintaining
  logical coherence. It navigates and completes games with up to 40% fewer steps and
  hints, performs robustly across difficulty levels, and achieves higher action success
  rates with more efficient and innovative puzzle-solving strategies.
